## Base-64-Python

# About
This program, written in Python 3, does Base 64 encoding and decoding using this process of changing 3 sets of 8 bits into 4 sets of 6-bits:

Original Data: A n d
ASCII Values: 65 110 100
8-bit Values: 01000001 01101110 01100100
6-bit Values: 010000 010110 111001 100100
6-bit Base 10 Values: 16 22 57 36
Base-64 Values: Q W 5 k

The program asks the user if they would like to encode or decode, then promps for a string in the correct format to be encoded or decoded, proforms the correct action, and outputs the result.
